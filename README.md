## Pre-requisites

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio
- [Rainbow HAT for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things) or the following individual components: 
    - breadboard
     - 2 LEDs
    - 1 Button
   

# Build and install

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you have everything set up correctly, when pressing the button, the red LED will turn on, then turn off and the green LED will turn on, then off.

## Enable auto-launch behavior

This sample app is currently configured to launch only when deployed from your
development machine. To enable the main activity to launch automatically on boot,
add the following `intent-filter` to the app's manifest file:

```xml
<activity ...>

    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    </intent-filter>

</activity>
```

And you will need to give the application some permissions in order to run correctly:
```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.things.permission.MANAGE_INPUT_DRIVERS" />
  <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.things.permission.USE_PERIPHERAL_IO" />
  <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.things.permission.MANAGE_BLUETOOTH" />
```
